# Freelancer
An app for freelancers to manage clients, projects, and invoices. View the demo here: https://powerful-escarpment-59873.herokuapp.com/

## UX
Freelancer is built using React and Redux and utilizes the material-ui library for a modern look. A strong emphasis was put on simplicity and efficiency. The time tracker is the heart of this app, allowing users to add their day's work to an invoice immediately, instead of trying to add it all up at the end of the billing cycle. Client contact info, project and invoice history, and more, is all readily available.
